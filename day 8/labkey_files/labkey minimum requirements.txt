1. look into modalities being used

2. Requested sample data plus protocol information
	a Protocol meta-data/ workflow
	b Assay Meta Data *ie Sample Tracking, 
	c Process Meta Data
	d Representative sample data

3. Assess Sample data for minimum requirements
	a. Subject ID
	a. Visit ID
	c. Sample ID
	d. Cohort (where applicable)
	e. Basic Demogrpahics 

4. Design Labkey Study Architechture
	a. Set up study
	b. modality sub folders
	c. add demographics table (if complete)
	d. add sample tracking information (if complete)

5. Review project architecture with study (iterative process)
	a. study format
	b. requirements
	c. security model 

6. Design Data Assays 
	a. implement standards and best practices where available 
	b. pre-made where possible
	c. etablish workflow for publishing 

7. Validation/Testing with admins (iterative)
	a. import of sample data (QA/QC)
	b. copy to study
	c. set up views and queries 
	d. remove assay designers accses to make changes (if IDP is designing)

DEMO STUDY IS NOW PREPARED BASED ON THEIR OWN REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE DATA

8. Data producer reviews demo study
	a. demo study is approved

9. Study goes into production

10. Training by IDP Assay Designer

11. Upload of Import of Data

12. Support and Troubleshooting
	a. custom queries
	b. integration
	c. support assay designer in making changes (x)
	d. account/access issues (x)
	e. import issues
	f. file reformatting

Raw
Processing
Final 


Goal
For each assay type we have defined requirements for:
	-protocol
	-raw
	-processed (intermediate valuable processed files)
	-final versioned data sets
